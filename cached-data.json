The GENIUS Act tasks Treasury (and various other federal agencies) with issuing regulations that encourage innovation in payment stablecoins while also providing an appropriately tailored regime to protect consumers, mitigate potential illicit finance risks, and address financial stability risks. Through this ANPRM, Treasury is seeking public comment on potential regulations that may be promulgated by Treasury, including regarding regulatory clarity, prohibitions on certain issuances and marketing, Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions obligations, the balance of state-level oversight with federal oversight, comparable foreign regulatory and supervisory regimes, and tax issues, among other things. Treasury is seeking comment on all aspects of the ANPRM from all interested parties and also requests commenters to identify other issues that Treasury should consider.",
